🔍 Email Summary
Sender: info@mail.smytten.com

Recipient: saimashaikh6015@gmail.com

Subject: "Product for FREE & Featured by Garnier?!"

⚠️ Phishing Indicators Found
Suspicious Subject Line:

Contains marketing bait and urgency ("FREE product", "Featured by Garnier?! 😲")—a common phishing tactic.

DKIM Validation Failed (Partial):

While the DKIM record exists and matches, the Body Hash Did Not Verify.

This suggests possible tampering with the email body after it was signed.

SPF and DMARC Passed:

The domain mail.smytten.com has correct SPF and DMARC configurations.

However, passing SPF/DMARC alone doesn't rule out phishing if the message was sent from a compromised service or spoofed subdomain.

Header Analysis:

The email originated from IP 149.72.115.29, which matches the authorized sending IP for mail.smytten.com.

But mismatches in DKIM body hash weaken authenticity.

✅ Legit Traits Noted
SPF, DKIM (partially), and DMARC are technically configured.

The sending domain matches the "From" address.

🧠 Conclusion
While the email has valid SPF and DMARC and appears to come from a legitimate domain, the DKIM body hash failure and the suspicious subject line suggest that the content may have been altered—this is a red flag for phishing.

👉 Caution is advised before clicking any links or replying to the email.
